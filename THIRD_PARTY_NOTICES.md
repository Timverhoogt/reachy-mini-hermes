The Home Assistant ESPHome wire framing and stable entity-key compatibility were
implemented with reference to the Reachy Mini Home Assistant app:

- Project: https://huggingface.co/spaces/djhui5710/reachy_mini_home_assistant
- Reference commit: `c5fd1f522ab44e8e9feb2897d4018027a8afb063`
- License: Apache License 2.0

The Hermes implementation is rewritten around its existing serialized robot
action controller, local opt-in gates, truthful unavailable states, same-peer
media validation, and mutually exclusive Hermes/Home Assistant voice ownership.

The camera joystick's 20 Hz target-stream cadence and drag-start geometry were
adapted from the official Pollen Robotics Reachy Mini Control controller module:

- Project: https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-desktop-app
- Reference commit: `0f150976f4a44db0cc4c3e30247f4d71e1fff42c`
- License: Apache License 2.0

The Hermes implementation is rewritten around gesture-bound sessions, a local
watchdog, cooperative Stop, privacy/Kids/Awake policy gates, and coupled
head-plus-base horizontal movement.

The Reachy Mini Hermes browser camera viewer includes an unmodified bundled copy
of `gstwebrtc-api.js`, sourced from Pollen Robotics' Reachy Mini Control desktop
application and originally maintained by the GStreamer project:
