# Hermes Reachy companion bridge

The companion bridge gives Reachy one authenticated endpoint for:

- Hermes API Server chat;
- model and voice discovery;
- configured or explicitly selected STT/TTS providers;
- a private OpenAI Realtime WebSocket;
- `ask_hermes` delegation from Realtime back into the user's Hermes agent.
- the fixed owner-scoped Agent broker: read tools, reversible home actions, timers/reminders, media, drafts, exact approvals, cancellation, and a sanitized timeline.
- local Realtime power-mode calls for Standby, Awake, timed Meeting, and Sleep.
- pass-through of on-demand Reachy camera frames to Realtime image input.

Provider credentials stay on the Hermes host. Reachy stores only the bridge URL and the private `API_SERVER_KEY` bearer token.

## Prerequisites

```bash
hermes config set API_SERVER_ENABLED true
hermes config set API_SERVER_KEY 'use-a-long-random-secret'
hermes gateway restart
```

Verify Hermes itself:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8642/health
```

For Realtime mode, add a direct OpenAI project key to the active profile's `.env`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-project-key
```

The OpenAI account must have API billing and access to `gpt-realtime-2.1`. A ChatGPT subscription alone is not an API credential.

Agent Mode is fail-closed: every read/action allowlist and reminder callback defaults empty. Configure only the resources Reachy may use in the bridge service environment:

```bash
HASS_URL=http://homeassistant.internal:8123
HASS_TOKEN=host-only-long-lived-token
REACHY_AGENT_HA_ALLOWLIST='{"sensor.living_room":["friendly_name","unit_of_measurement"]}'
REACHY_AGENT_HA_ACTION_ALLOWLIST='{"light.desk":["turn_on","turn_off"]}'
REACHY_AGENT_MEDIA_ALLOWLIST='["media_player.living_room"]'
REACHY_AGENT_CALENDAR_ALLOWLIST='["calendar.personal"]'
REACHY_AGENT_NOTIFY_ALLOWLIST='{"mobile_app":["tim"]}'
REACHY_AGENT_NOTE_ROOTS='{"notes":"/absolute/path/to/reachy-notes"}'
REACHY_AGENT_PERSONAL_ROOTS='{"memory":"/absolute/path/to/scoped-memory"}'
REACHY_AGENT_HISTORY_ROOTS='{"history":"/absolute/path/to/scoped-history"}'
REACHY_AGENT_SEARCH_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8888/search
REACHY_AGENT_MODEL=gpt-5-mini
REACHY_AGENT_ASK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=80
REACHY_AGENT_REMINDER_CALLBACK_URL=https://reachy-private-host
REACHY_AGENT_REMINDER_CALLBACK_TOKEN=the-same-private-bridge-bearer-token
```

Roots must be absolute. Note reads and approved appends reject traversal, symlinks, hardlinks, non-regular files, unsupported extensions, and oversized files. Home Assistant returns or controls only explicit allowlists; its token never enters a result. Timers/reminders are accepted only when the authenticated callback is configured. Media and calendar/message/note writes pause in a five-minute exact-action sheet on the trusted phone UI; approval is one-shot and content edits require a new draft.

## Run the bridge

Use the Python environment that belongs to Hermes Agent:

```bash
cd ~/.hermes/hermes-agent
venv/bin/python /path/to/reachy_mini_hermes/companion/hermes_reachy_bridge.py \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 8643
```

The bridge resolves secrets from the selected Hermes profile's environment, `.env`, and configuration. For another profile:

```bash
venv/bin/python /path/to/hermes_reachy_bridge.py \
  --profile my-profile \
  --host 0.0.0.0
```

Configure Reachy with:

```text
Bridge URL: http://<hermes-host-LAN-IP>:8643
API key:    the same API_SERVER_KEY
```

## API surface

All `/v1/*` routes require:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <API_SERVER_KEY>
```

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | Hermes, provider, and Realtime availability |
| `GET /v1/models` | Reachy-compatible Hermes model routes |
| `GET /v1/voice-options` | STT/TTS models and account voices |
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | Authenticated proxy to Hermes API Server |
| `POST /v1/kids/chat` | Bounded, pre/post-moderated child chat without Hermes memory/tools |

|| `POST /v1/agent/ask` | Bounded model loop using only broker tools |
| `POST /v1/agent/cancel/{request_id}` | Cancel an in-flight broker/Agent request |

The Realtime client sends an initial `session.start` envelope containing model, voice, reasoning effort, Hermes agent route, stable memory scope, system prompt, and the camera/robot-tool feature flags. The bridge then creates the OpenAI GA Realtime session and exposes `ask_hermes`, the always-available local `set_reachy_power_mode` tool, and only the enabled camera/motion tools. Sleep and Meeting are applied on Reachy itself; no privileged credential is sent to the robot.

### Realtime trust boundary

OpenAI may answer ordinary conversation directly. The session instructions require `ask_hermes` for:

- personal or persistent memory;
- current information;
- Home Assistant or other connected devices;
- local files and system state;
- consequential actions.

In Conversation profile, the bridge executes `ask_hermes` through the authenticated local Hermes API Server. In Agent profile, the same single Realtime tool enters a bounded model loop with fixed T0–T3 schemas and no shell, arbitrary filesystem, maintenance, purchase, lock, alarm, garage, climate-safety, or security-system authority. T1 private reads require matching present-turn intent. T3 writes and all media actions stage exact device/session-scoped drafts for trusted-phone approval. OpenAI does not receive the Hermes bearer token or provider/home credentials, and Reachy does not receive the OpenAI or Home Assistant keys.

When Reachy enables camera support, the bridge advertises `capture_reachy_camera`. The tool call is forwarded to Reachy, which captures one bounded JPEG and sends it as an `input_image` conversation item. The bridge never polls or continuously streams the camera.

When Reachy enables robot tools, the bridge advertises `move_reachy_head`, `express_reachy_emotion`, and `dance_reachy`. The bridge never executes these physical actions itself: completed calls are forwarded to the robot, where an allow-listed local worker performs them. Knowledge, Home Assistant, files, memory, and consequential actions continue to route through `ask_hermes`.

### Kids Mode trust boundary

`/v1/kids/chat` is a separate, bounded OpenAI chat route. It does not forward Hermes session headers or normal agent history, and it applies moderation before and after generation. The bridge accepts only age-band/activity/language enums, constructs the child policy itself, and owns bounded ephemeral history keyed by the random child session ID; caller-supplied system prompts and history are rejected. Camera, robot, agent/delegation, Home Assistant, file, messaging, purchase, and power capabilities are absent during child conversation.

I Spy uses a separate consented boundary: `/v1/kids/ispy/select` accepts exactly three bounded JPEGs, requests a strict structured target, revalidates stability, visibility count, confidence, frame index, normalized bounding box, colour, forbidden vocabulary and hints, then moderates the target text before storing only target metadata. The camera is revoked before guessing. `/v1/kids/chat` judges guesses with a boolean-only schema while local bridge state owns the hint order and six-guess reveal limit. `/v1/kids/ispy/cancel` deletes the target and approval state on Stop, expiry, or a cancelled start; image bytes are never retained in session state.

The Kids `/v1/kids/speech/stream` and `/v1/kids/speech/fallback` paths accept only bounded text carrying their own short-lived, single-use bridge approval tied to the exact child session and normalized post-moderated text digest. The streaming provider, model, output format, and default voice are bridge-controlled: ElevenLabs `eleven_flash_v2_5`, 24 kHz PCM, and the configured `ELEVENLABS_KIDS_VOICE_ID` (or bundled child-voice default); fallback ignores caller provider/model/voice fields and invokes the Hermes host's configured TTS. Missing, expired, altered, or replayed approvals are rejected; the route does not accept arbitrary provider/model selection or unmoderated model tokens.

## Run at boot with systemd

The included example assumes this repository is cloned to `~/reachy_mini_hermes`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp companion/hermes-reachy-bridge.service.example \
  ~/.config/systemd/user/hermes-reachy-bridge.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now hermes-reachy-bridge.service
```

Verify with:

```bash
systemctl --user status hermes-reachy-bridge.service
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_SERVER_KEY" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8643/health
```

Expected Realtime health fields:

```json
{
  "realtime_available": true,
  "kids_chat_available": true,
  "kids_tts_streaming_available": true,
  "realtime_model": "gpt-realtime-2.1"
}
```

## Logs

```bash
journalctl --user -u hermes-reachy-bridge.service -f
```

The bridge must not log bearer tokens, OpenAI keys, ElevenLabs keys, or response audio. Keep Hermes secret redaction enabled.

## Security

- The default bind address is `127.0.0.1`.
- Bind to `0.0.0.0` only on a trusted LAN or VPN.
- Every chat/audio/discovery/Realtime route uses constant-time bearer-token authentication.
- Provider keys remain on the Hermes host.
- The bearer token can invoke a tool-capable agent; treat it as an administrative credential.
- For remote access, use TLS and an authenticated reverse proxy. Never expose raw port `8643` publicly.
- Rotate both the bearer token and any provider credential after suspected disclosure.
