# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The project currently remains in early alpha and has not published a stable compatibility promise.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Opt-in local HaGRID ONNX gesture pipeline with pinned Apache-2.0 model checksums, 3 FPS in-memory inference, repeated-frame confirmation, edge triggering, cooldowns, truthful HA telemetry, and no-auto-wake/Kids/privacy/action-ownership gates. Palm produces a welcome, peace an excited response, and rock one short dance.
- Home Assistant `Awake` switch gated by the explicit robot-controls opt-in; On uses the serialized verified wake transition, while Off folds safely and releases torque through Standby.
- Agent 0.1 read-only Reachy Agent Broker with eight typed capabilities for live manifest/status, allowlisted Home Assistant state, current public information/pages, personal context, conversation history, and scoped notes.
- Authenticated execute/ask/cancel/activity bridge routes, typed Reachy client contracts, evidence/freshness metadata, strict private-intent and session-generation checks, bounded redaction, and a sanitized PWA activity timeline.
- Traversal/symlink-safe scoped reads, public-page SSRF/redirect/size protections, empty-by-default entity/root allowlists, and cancellation that prevents stale results from reaching speech.
- Agent owner actions for verified reversible Home Assistant control and undo, authenticated timer/reminder delivery, approval-gated media, calendar reads/drafts/creates, single-recipient message drafts/sends, and symlink/hardlink-safe note drafts/appends.
- Trusted-phone exact approval sheet with five-minute device/session-scoped drafts, one-shot execution, edit/replay rejection, and Kids/privacy/generation invalidation.
- BlueZ-backed Bluetooth discovery, pairing, trust, connect, disconnect, and forget controls in the trusted Robot tab.
- Opt-in Linux joystick monitoring restricted to Sony-vendor DualShock 4 and DualSense identities with the validated PlayStation mapping; other layouts fail closed.
- Safe gamepad mapping for bounded look, center, Happy, Surprised, and cooperative Stop actions.
- Integrated Kids Mode I Spy with explicit caregiver camera consent, a visible bounded three-frame search, strict stable-target validation, deterministic hint/guess/reveal state, authoritative Stop/expiry cancellation, and bridge-session deletion.
- Bluetooth/controller operational guidance, service-account permissions, explicit Reachy Mini Wireless-only hardware scope, security boundaries, and hardware-free regression tests.
- Optional camera-feed thumb joystick with separate off-by-default opt-in, left/right placement, dead zone, spring-return visuals, keyboard support, in-overlay Stop, explicit head/base Center, native and fallback fullscreen handling, and mobile safe-area layout.
- Gesture-bound camera-control API sessions with random identifiers, monotonic anti-replay sequences, bounded finite pan/tilt, cancellable head interpolation, server-owned base assistance, release-to-hold, settings/power/privacy/Kids revocation, and generic-control ownership exclusion.
- Optional ESPHome-native Home Assistant bridge on TCP 6053 with the existing stable Reachy device/entity identity, mDNS discovery, real telemetry, truthful unavailable states, and independently gated controls and camera snapshots.
- Opt-in Home Assistant Assist ownership after local wake detection, including 16 kHz PCM streaming, HA pipeline state/motion cues, bounded same-peer TTS/media playback, announcements, follow-up support, and privacy/disconnect/timeout cancellation.

### Changed

- Agent single-request UX now keeps the sanitized broker timeline pollable during an active voice request, shows the running capability or exact approval wait in the trusted UI, and prompts for concise natural speech without reading internal capability IDs aloud.
- PWA shell advanced to v38 for the Agent activity/progress UI.
- PWA shell advanced to v37 for the documented Home Assistant Awake control.
- Home Assistant camera snapshots are normalized to metadata-free baseline 4:2:0 JPEGs before ESPHome transport, preventing intermittent green/magenta rendering on older Android/WebView hardware decoders while leaving native and AI camera frames unchanged.
- Kids Mode no longer requires setup, entry, lockout, or unlock of a parent PIN. Start is direct from the trusted local UI; the child-only dashboard remains active for the session, and Stop immediately restores management controls.
- PWA shell advanced to v36 for the PIN-free Kids Mode controls.
- Kids I Spy now retains five bounded viewpoints across a 240° base arc, uses non-capturing 60° transit waypoints, revokes camera access before its neutral return, and keeps the head aligned with the base.
- Manual base control now uses separate 5°/15°/30°/60° steps, clear-space confirmation for wide turns, coupled head yaw, and a ±120° application limit inside the SDK's ±160° range.
- Camera joystick motion now follows a Pollen-inspired 20 Hz smoothed target stream: horizontal input rotates the head and base together, vertical input tilts the head, and a short watchdog stops abandoned browser gestures.
- PWA shell advanced to v35 for the Home Assistant bridge settings and live connection status.
- Fullscreen Exit uses explicit horizontal and vertical centering, and the PWA shell advances to v34 for the new controls.
- PWA shell advanced to v33 for the pinned joystick geometry and stable status layout.
- PWA shell advanced to v32 for the camera-control overlay and fullscreen-safe controls.
- PWA shell advanced to v31 for the wider base controls and five-frame I Spy status.
- Agent profile `ask_hermes` now uses only the fixed bounded T0–T3 broker surface; Realtime still advertises a single delegation tool and ordinary social conversation remains direct.
- PWA shell advanced to v30 for visible Kids I Spy camera-search state and Stop access during startup.
- PWA shell advanced to v29 for exact Agent action review and approval.
- PWA shell advanced to v27 for the Agent 0.1 timeline and Kids-mode card hiding.
- PWA shell advanced to v21 for the reviewed Bluetooth controller UI.

### Verified

- Ruff, Python compilation, JavaScript syntax, and all 350 automated tests pass.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Dual conversation modes: configurable Hermes pipeline and OpenAI `gpt-realtime-2.1` speech-to-speech.
- Authenticated GA Realtime WebSocket proxy on the companion bridge.
- Streaming PCM audio, semantic VAD, transcript events, selectable Marin/Cedar voices, and configurable reasoning effort.
- `ask_hermes` function delegation for persistent memory, current information, Home Assistant, files, and consequential actions.
- ElevenLabs Scribe and TTS provider/model selection with account voice discovery.
- Pipeline interruption by repeating **“Hey Hermes”** during playback.
- Additional local **“Okay Nabu”** and **“Hey Reachy”** wake phrases, available for initial wake and pipeline playback interruption.
- Realtime natural interruption and streamed-output flushing.
- Standby, Awake, timed Meeting, Sleep, app-off, and confirmed Pi shutdown controls.
- Motor torque and microphone lifecycle management for privacy/power states.
- Tabbed settings UI with Dashboard, Kids, Announce, Robot, and Settings workspaces for clearer desktop, mobile, and Reachy Control use.
- Supervised Kids Mode with five activity profiles, 4–12 age bands, English/Dutch speech, 15–60 minute monotonic server sessions, salted `scrypt` parent-PIN controls, status/transcript redaction, automatic safe folding, optional gentle voice-state motion, and a dedicated moderated child pipeline with no camera, normal Hermes memory, files, messaging, devices, purchases, power tools, or explicit robot actions.
- Kids-only ElevenLabs Flash v2.5 low-latency speech streaming with fixed 24 kHz PCM, private bridge credentials, immediate chunk playback, and configured-TTS fallback.
- Full announcement console with exact-text TTS, provider/model/voice overrides, quick templates, repeat/pause controls, a bounded serialized queue, independent Stop/clear, session-scoped browser draft preservation, and voice-only, wake-and-return, or stay-awake behavior.
- Manual semantic robot controls now include live Cartesian pose readout and bounded 1/2.5/5/10-unit precision steps for X/Y/Z translation, head roll/pitch/yaw, rotating-base yaw, and independent head/base/all centering, alongside confirmed motor/fold state, safe wake/fold power actions, nine-way head direction, curated expressions, dances, and cooperative movement cancellation.
- Priority Stop behavior, privacy revalidation at execution time, busy-request rejection, persistent action state, and mobile-safe controls prevent delayed or post-privacy motion. Precision motion uses app-owned 50 Hz interpolation so Stop/Meeting/Sleep can cancel both head and base movement; folding now waits for action-worker idle and re-verifies the physical sleep pose before torque release.
- Installable Android PWA metadata, branded icons, a root-scoped service worker, Dashboard install UX, and an HTTP Add-to-Home-Screen fallback.
- Realtime client, silence playback asset, and tests for Realtime audio and power-state behavior.
- Optional on-demand Reachy camera tool with local diagnostics and Realtime image input.
- Authenticated, non-cacheable one-frame snapshot route for explicit image sharing.
- Opt-in Robot-tab live viewer for the daemon's existing local WebRTC camera feed, with explicit Awake-only policy, muted audio, no public STUN dependency, and automatic disconnect on privacy/background transitions.
- Privacy-controlled daemon-local face following that runs only during an active post-wake conversation.
- Optional wake-time DOA orientation using Reachy's local microphone-array direction estimate.
- Curated Realtime robot tools for look direction, authentic recorded emotions, and three recorded dance styles.
- Local Realtime power-mode tool for explicit Standby, Awake, timed Meeting, and Sleep commands.
- Native Reachy `goto_sleep()` transition before Sleep releases torque, with fail-safe torque retention if the movement fails.
- Pose-aware safe folding before every Standby/Meeting/startup torque release, preventing a head drop when the app is restarted while Reachy is upright.
- Serialized action worker that yields face/voice motion during explicit moves and cancels actions on Meeting/Sleep.
- Operations runbook covering deployment, rollback, cooling maintenance, health checks, and acoustic acceptance.

### Changed

- Reachy starts in Standby with motor torque disabled while local wake processing remains active.
- Provider secrets remain on the Hermes host; Reachy receives only a private bridge bearer token.
- Companion health output reports Realtime, moderated Kids chat, and Kids Flash streaming availability.
- Voice status exposes power mode, Meeting timer, provider state, and interruption count.
- Documentation now describes the dual-mode architecture and security boundaries.
- The local camera viewer selects `ws://` on direct LAN HTTP and `wss://` on trusted HTTPS deployments, allowing Tailscale Serve to secure both the PWA and WebRTC signaling.
- The Robot tab now groups confirmed torque/fold state with Wake, safe Fold, and Stop controls; adds bounded diagonal looks, descriptive expression presets, dance-footprint labels, and clear-space confirmation for wide motion.
- Power and wake/fold transitions are serialized across clients; daemon, wake-motion, and torque-release failures now return explicit errors, keep the last confirmed motor state visible, and prevent false-success UI messages or post-release action execution.
- Hugging Face app page now presents wake phrases, supervised Kids Mode, voice, interruption, camera, Hermes-tool, and power/privacy architecture.

### Fixed

- Updated OpenAI integration from the retired beta Realtime API shape to the GA protocol.
- Added the required Realtime output sample rate.
- App-off no longer waits on the daemon response from inside the process being stopped, removing a ten-second shutdown cycle and traceback.
- Realtime interruption tracks locally buffered audio after server generation finishes, immediately flushes Reachy playback, and truncates the unplayed OpenAI conversation audio.
- Camera access defaults to off and captures only one fresh JPEG per explicit Realtime visual-tool call.
- Camera capture waits for a completed tool item, deduplicates call IDs, and remains blocked in Meeting/Sleep; authenticated snapshots and local diagnostics now enforce and recheck the same privacy boundary while waiting for a frame.
- The local viewer closes both media sessions and signaling sockets, accepts only Reachy's named camera producer, and fails closed when runtime status disappears or the voice app stops.
- Awake now runs Reachy's physical wake-up motion instead of only enabling motor torque.
- Meeting and Sleep stop active playback and microphone capture before disabling motors.
- Meeting/Sleep action cancellation now restarts Reachy's playback backend when returning to Standby/Awake.
- Motion cancellation uses generation checks so dequeued actions cannot start after a privacy transition.
- Wake activation rechecks privacy before motors, face tracking, and cloud conversation startup.
- Pipeline synthesis and playback recheck privacy before starting TTS audio.
- `ask_hermes` now executes only for completed, deduplicated Realtime function-call items.
- Robot function-call output now reports the actual physical execution result instead of queue acceptance.
- DOA orientation accepts only a recent speech-validated, finite microphone-array estimate.
- Realtime barge-in now tracks only assistant audio-message item IDs, so function calls cannot make `conversation.item.truncate` target a non-audio item and terminate the session.
- A rejected truncation remains non-fatal after the local playback queue has already been cleared.

### Verified

- Ruff passes and 134 automated tests pass.
- Reachy's app assistant passes the repository structure and metadata checks. Its isolated-install phase remains host-blocked by the upstream `PyGObject`/Cairo build dependency; the complete suite passes in the Reachy SDK 1.9 validation environment.
- Realtime session creation, audio response, configurable reasoning, and Hermes tool delegation succeed against the live API.
- ElevenLabs TTS/STT round trip succeeds; Kids Flash streaming reaches Reachy as 24 kHz PCM with a measured 375 ms first chunk on the reference network.
- Automated checks cover moderated child chat, lockout, status redaction, timer generation guards, stream cancellation, and fold-outcome reporting; the earlier reference hardware run verified parent stop, safe fold, torque release, and Standby.
- `Okay Nabu` and `Hey Reachy` detect in synthesized acceptance audio; `Hey Hermes` remains verified with live microphone input.
- Reachy power states, clean app stop/restart, API soak tests, motor mode, and daemon health pass on the reference Reachy Mini Lite deployment.
