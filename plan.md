# Reachy Mini Hermes — implementation plan and status

## Goal

Ship a public Reachy Mini Python app that wakes locally on **“Hey Hermes”**, **“Okay Nabu”**, or **“Hey Reachy”**, supports low-latency embodied conversation, preserves the user's Hermes identity and tools in normal mode, and provides a separate supervised Kids Mode with materially reduced capabilities.

## Product principles

- Wake-phrase processing remains local; cloud audio starts only after local detection.
- Provider credentials remain on the Hermes host.
- Reachy stores only a private bridge URL and bearer token.
- Ordinary conversation stays fast; tool-using normal requests may delegate to Hermes.
- Kids Mode is a backend-enforced child pipeline, not a visual theme.
- Camera, private memory, files, messaging, devices, purchases, power, and explicit robot actions are unavailable to the child model.
- Voice, privacy, child-lock, timer, and physical power states remain visible and reversible.
- Every torque release is preceded by a verified safe fold when motor power is available.
- Browser and model actions use allow-listed semantic movement rather than raw motor primitives.

## Implemented architecture

### Realtime mode

```text
Reachy local KWS
  → authenticated private companion WebSocket
  → OpenAI gpt-realtime-2.1
      ↳ ask_hermes → Hermes memory, tools, Home Assistant, files, current information
      ↳ one-frame camera request when explicitly enabled
      ↳ allow-listed local look, emotion, dance, and power-mode tools
  → streamed audio + serialized Reachy motion
```

Implemented:

- OpenAI GA Realtime protocol with 24 kHz PCM and device-rate resampling;
- semantic VAD, local playback accounting, queue flushing, and interruption;
- configurable voice and reasoning effort;
- completed/deduplicated tool-call handling;
- optional one-frame vision, local face following, and wake-time DOA;
- credentials isolated to the Hermes host.

### Normal Hermes pipeline

```text
Reachy local KWS
  → adaptive local endpointing
  → selected STT
  → Hermes API Server agent
  → selected TTS
  → Reachy playback + serialized motion
```

Implemented:

- configured and ElevenLabs STT/TTS selection;
- model and account-voice discovery;
- stable Hermes memory scope with rotating conversation IDs;
- continued conversation;
- playback interruption with any configured local wake phrase.

### Supervised Kids Mode

```text
Reachy local KWS
  → adaptive local endpointing
  → configured STT
  → authenticated /v1/kids/chat
      ↳ bounded ephemeral child history
      ↳ input and complete-output moderation
      ↳ no normal Hermes session, memory, or tools
  → authenticated /v1/kids/speech/stream
      ↳ ElevenLabs Flash v2.5
      ↳ fixed 24 kHz PCM
  → interruptible Reachy playback + optional gentle voice-state motion
```

Implemented:

- five activities: Buddy chat, Story maker, Quiz quest, Riddle box, and Calm corner;
- age bands 4–6, 7–9, and 10–12 in English or Dutch;
- parent-selected 15/30/45/60-minute sessions with a monotonic authoritative deadline and five-minute warning;
- 6–8 digit parent PIN stored only as a salted `scrypt` verifier, with a five-attempt/five-minute lockout;
- public transcript, response-preview, nickname, and child-session-ID redaction while locked;
- camera, robot, agent/delegation, Home Assistant, messaging, files, purchases, and power tools blocked;
- complete-answer moderation before any child speech starts;
- fixed-policy Flash streaming, prompt cancellation, queue clearing, parent stop, expiry, safe fold, and torque release.

### Local dashboard and physical lifecycle

Implemented:

- five keyboard-accessible tabs: Dashboard, Kids, Announce, Robot, and Settings;
- exact-text announcement queue with provider/model/voice overrides and physical behavior policy;
- bounded manual look, expression, dance, precision Cartesian/head/base controls, live pose, independent centering, and priority Stop;
- BlueZ controller discovery/pair/trust/connect management plus opt-in `/dev/input/js*` monitoring;
- Sony-vendor DualShock 4/DualSense bounded look, center, Happy, Surprised, and Stop mappings routed through the existing safety gates; unsupported identities fail closed;
- installable Android PWA with synchronized cache versioning;
- Standby, Awake, timed Meeting, Sleep, app-off, and confirmed Pi shutdown;
- private Tailscale-compatible HTTPS/WSS camera deployment;
- serialized movement, privacy rechecks, safe-fold interlocks, and motor/microphone lifecycle management.

## Current verification status

Automated and packaging:

- Ruff, Python compilation, JavaScript syntax, and `git diff --check` pass.
- **143 pytest tests pass** in a clean Reachy SDK 1.9 environment with GStreamer bindings.
- Wheel and source distributions build successfully.
- `reachy-mini-app-assistant check .` passes all repository structure and metadata checks; its isolated-install phase is blocked on this workstation by the upstream Reachy Mini `PyGObject` dependency requiring Cairo development headers. The complete app suite is instead exercised in the Reachy SDK 1.9 environment with GStreamer bindings above.
- Tracked and untracked publication files pass provider-key/token-prefix scanning.

Live bridge and cloud providers:

- OpenAI Realtime session creation, audio response, reasoning configuration, and Hermes tool delegation succeed.
- OpenAI moderation and the dedicated child chat route succeed.
- ElevenLabs TTS/STT succeed.
- Kids Flash v2.5 streaming returns fixed 24 kHz PCM; the reference Reachy received its first chunk in approximately 375 ms.

Physical Reachy deployment:

- the app installs and starts through the Reachy daemon;
- the deployed five-tab UI and PWA v18 load without browser-console errors;
- one supervised Dutch Kids session completed STT, moderated child chat, synthesis, parent stop, safe fold, torque release, and Standby;
- `Hey Hermes` is verified with live microphone input;
- `Okay Nabu` and `Hey Reachy` are verified against generated acceptance audio and load in the live three-phrase keyword graph;
- camera, motor, power, app restart, bridge, daemon, and watchdog checks have passed on the reference Reachy Mini Lite;
- on the current Raspberry Pi target, BlueZ 5.82, the onboard adapter, RF unblocking, classic/LE discovery, `bluetoothctl` authorization, and `input` group access are verified; final Reachy Mini Wireless DualShock pairing and mapping acceptance is deferred;
- the green GPIO17 button is electrically verified with one debounced falling edge on press and one rising edge on release. GPIO behavior is not yet integrated into the app.

Human acceptance still required per hardware/audio environment:

- real spoken initial-wake checks for all three wake phrases;
- natural Realtime turn-taking and acoustic interruption at normal room distance;
- microphone/speaker quality after enclosure, cooling, or wiring changes;
- caregiver review of Kids Mode outputs appropriate to the intended age and activity.

## Performance observations

| Path | Reference observation |
|---|---:|
| Native Realtime short response | ~1.2 s |
| ElevenLabs TTS | ~0.6 s |
| Kids Flash PCM first chunk | ~0.375 s |
| ElevenLabs STT | ~1.1 s |
| Full Hermes pipeline agent request | ~14 s |
| Realtime request invoking `ask_hermes` | ~23 s in validation |

These are deployment observations, not service-level guarantees. Hermes pipeline latency is dominated by agent/context preparation; Realtime is the low-latency normal conversational path, while Kids Mode prioritizes moderation and capability reduction before streamed speech.

## Packaging and release scope

- Package and app entry point: `reachy_mini_hermes` / `ReachyMiniHermes`.
- Current release line: **0.2.x early alpha**.
- Reachy settings UI: port `8042`.
- Companion bridge: port `8643`, loopback by default.
- License: Apache-2.0 with retained third-party notices.
- GitHub is the source/release surface; the Hugging Face static Space is the public app page and mirrored app-discovery repository.

## Deferred work

- Integrate the green/red Raspberry Pi buttons through `libgpiod` with pull-ups, debounce, short/long-press semantics, startup ownership, and safe failure behavior.
- Persist parent lock/session recovery policy across process restarts if the deployment requires crash continuity.
- Add phrase-specific real-room acoustic acceptance recordings and tune per-keyword score/threshold only from measured false-positive/false-negative data.
- Downgrade empty STT/silence from an error to a normal no-speech turn.
- Replace the raw watchdog TCP media probe with a WebSocket-aware check to remove benign handshake warnings.
- Add local offline STT/TTS fallback for deployments that require operation without cloud providers.
- Add route-specific warm Hermes-agent reuse with session serialization, cache signatures, lifecycle controls, and usage accounting.
- Expand simulated robot integration tests and establish a reproducible CI environment for Reachy SDK/GStreamer imports.
